I’m an Associate Professor at [Inland University of Applied
Sciences](https://www.inn.no). My research interests include factors
that explain variability in responses to exercise training. To learn new
things about my favorite topics I like to integrate statistical methods,
bioinformatics, and physiological data gathered from exercise training
studies. My teaching duties include molecular and statistical methods at
our health and exercise physiology MA program and supervision of BA, MA,
and Ph.D. students.

I’m part of the [trainome research group](trainome.github.io),
collectively we want to better understand why people responds to
exercise training and find out how we can design better exercise
training interventions for different populations.
